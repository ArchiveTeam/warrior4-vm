# Warrior 4 VM

This repository contains the [Warrior](https://wiki.archiveteam.org/index.php/ArchiveTeam_Warrior) Virtual Machine Appliance Version 4 for [ArchiveTeam](https://archiveteam.org).

üíø If you are looking to download the warrior, a ready-to-use virtual appliance is located at the Releases section or at [Warrior HQ downloads](https://warriorhq.archiveteam.org/downloads/warrior4/). You'll need a virtualization solution of your choice such as [VirtualBox](https://www.virtualbox.org/).

üêã If you are looking to run the warrior in a Docker container, use the image available from [warrior-dockerfile](https://github.com/ArchiveTeam/warrior-dockerfile).

If you want to see the older version 3, see [Ubuntu-Warrior](https://github.com/ArchiveTeam/Ubuntu-Warrior). For the web user interface that manages projects, see [seesaw-kit](https://github.com/ArchiveTeam/seesaw-kit/).

## Support

* If you need help or troubleshooting information, check the [FAQs](https://wiki.archiveteam.org/index.php/ArchiveTeam_Warrior) or Issues section to see if your problem has been answered already. If you want to to discuss in general, join hackint IRC [#warrior](https://webirc.hackint.org/#irc://irc.hackint.org/#warrior) channel.
* For bug reports about the virtual machine appliance/image itself, please file an issue on the Issues section. If you have a bug report on the web interface, please use the Issues section on the [seesaw-kit](https://github.com/ArchiveTeam/seesaw-kit/) project.

### Known issues

* OVA file may not be fully compatible with other virtual machine software.
  * In this case, you will need to download the disk image instead and manually configure a new virtual machine to use them. See the next section for details.
* Some issues may still remain from version 3.

### Using the disk images

Using the disk image directly is intended for advanced cases or when the OVA file is not compatible. This will expand to 60GB.

In some cases, such as using ESXi, you may need to "reformat" the image to work. This can be done using `vmkfstools -i input.vmdk output.vmdk`. See [VMWare docs](https://kb.vmware.com/s/article/1028943) for more information.

To use the disk image:

1. Download the supported format: vmdk (VMware) or qcow2 (QEMU).
2. Decompress them (unzip/gunzip).
3. Move the disk image file to where your virtual machines are saved. Since the VM software will use this existing file as its storage disk, you may want to keep a copy of the original to avoid having to redownload a new disk image.
4. Create a new machine (select either Alpine Linux 64-bit variant if available, or else "Other Linux (64-bit)") and choose the existing disk file that you have downloaded and moved.
5. Configure the machine as described in the next section.

Here are the suggested defaults:

| Hardware | Value |
| -------- | ----- |
| Memory | 1024 MB |
| Video memory | 16 MB |
| 3D graphics | off |
| CPUs | 2 |
| Network | NAT |
| USB | off |
| Audio | off |

When using NAT network type, port forwarding is required to access the web interface. The following allows you to access port 8001 on localhost that is forwarded to the VM's port 8001:

| Name | Host address | Host port | VM address | VM port |
| ---- | ------------ | --------- | ------------- | ---------- |
| Web Interface | 127.0.0.1 | 8001 | | 8001 |

#### Additional configuration

The virtual machine may reboot to apply updates or refresh itself. If your hypervisor does not support guests issuing a reset command, the virtual machine may stop without restarting. In this case, configure your hypervisor to automatically restart the virtual machine if it stops.

## Frequently asked questions about the VM

**Q. How do I get my keyboard or mouse untrapped in the virtual machine window?**

A. On VirtualBox, press the right-side Alt key.

**Q. I run a Docker container and a VM. If I log in to the container and log in to the VM, why are the environments vastly different?**

A. This VM does not directly run what is listed in the Dockerfile. The VM actually is an operating system shell that runs and manages Docker containers (which uses the images genereated by the Dockerfile).

Technically, this VM can run any Docker container at all!

**Q. What is the purpose of the VM if I can run Docker myself?**

A. If you rather run the Docker containers yourself, you may do so. The purpose of the VM is to ensure that users get a consistent environment that is difficult for users to accidentally misconfigure.

**Q. How do I log in (for troubleshooting/debugging)?**

A. Use the LeftAlt+RightArrow and LeftAlt+LeftArrow keys to switch terminals. The login screen will tell you the password.

Logging files are placed in `/var/log/`.

Note that you are logged into the VM OS, not the Docker container. Use the Docker tool to log in to the `warrior` container as needed. The container user is `warrior`. Project download data stored in `/data/`.

**Q. My question is not here?**
